      <h2>What I Learned This Semester</h2>
      <p>
        Alright, let me just saythis semester was a journey. 
        I came into this class thinking HTML and CSS would be hard but maybe somewhat chill, but I quickly realized how deep the rabbit hole goes. 
        I basically lived on W3Schools. I‚Äôm not kidding, I had that site open almost every time I was working on a lab. 
        That place is the G.O.A.T. If something broke or wasn‚Äôt working the way I thought it should, chances are W3 had a solution (or at least pointed me in the right direction).

        One of my biggest struggles this semester was colors. For some reason, picking a good color scheme felt like rocket science. 
        I'd put together a page, then step back and realize it looked like it was built by a blind person. 
        That‚Äôs when I started asking ChatGPT for some help. 
        I‚Äôd describe the vibe/color theme I wanted or say something like, ‚ÄúMake it not ugly,‚Äù and boom‚Äîit would give me a decent color combo that actually worked. 
        That saved me more times than I can count.
      </p>

        Another thing I learned is how important it is to test your site on different browsers and devices. 
        I made a page that looked totally fine on my laptop, but when I opened it on my phone, it was a complete mess. 
        That‚Äôs when I finally started playing around with media queries and responsive design. 
        Mobilefirst design makes a lot more sense to me now. Testing in Firefox, Chrome, and on my phone really helped me understand how stuff can break or look totally different.

        Overall, I think this class really helped me understand how websites are structured. 
        I didn‚Äôt just throw content on a page, I learned about hierarchy, semantic elements, and making things more accessible. 
        I definitely still have a lot to learn, but I‚Äôm way more confident now than I was at the beginning of the semester.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come. Yeah, I leaned on the internet and AI a bunch, but I also learned how to troubleshoot, how to plan out a layout, and how to make something a toddler designed. 
        If nothing else, I walk away knowing I built this whole site from scratch, and that‚Äôs pretty dope.
