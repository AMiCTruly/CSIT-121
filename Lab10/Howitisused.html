  <h1>How is TTML IMSC1 Used?</h1>
  <p>
    TTML IMSC1 is used to create and display subtitles and captions for videos that are posted online. 
    Whether it’s a YouTube video, a streaming show, or a training module, this standard makes sure the captions show up correctly and at the right time. 
    It helps keep everything in sync with the video so people can read along without distractions. 
    This is super helpful for viewers who rely on captions to understand what's being said. 
    Without a standard like TTML IMSC1, captions could end up being messy or totally out of sync.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One of the cool things about TTML IMSC1 is that it lets you customize how the text looks. 
    You can adjust the font size, change the color, or move the captions to a different part of the screen. 
    This comes in handy when you want to match the style of the video. 
    It also supports things like bold or italic text to show emphasis or tone. These features help make the captions easier to read and more visually appealing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TTML IMSC1 also supports both text and image-based subtitles(crazy). 
    So if a company wants to use fancy styled captions or use a specific font that isn't supported by all devices, they can just render the captions as images. 
    This gives content creators more flexibility when designing their captions. On the flip side, plain text captions are lighter and more accessible for assistive technologies, so TTML covers both needs. 
    Having those options is important for making content work well on different platforms.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another way TTML IMSC1 is used is when converting between caption formats. 
    Since it’s a widely accepted standard, it makes it easier for developers to convert subtitles from other formats like SRT or VTT into TTML without losing quality. 
    That’s useful when publishing to platforms that require specific formats. It also helps keep everything organized, especially when working with large video libraries. 
    In the end, TTML IMSC1 just makes subtitle workflows smoother and more reliable.

  <h2>Example Usage</h2>
  <pre>
  &lt;tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;styling&gt;
        &lt;style xml:id="s1" tts:fontSize="12px"/&gt;
      &lt;/styling&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p begin="00:00:01.000" end="00:00:04.000" style="s1"&gt;
          Hello, world!
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/tt&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    This example displays a subtitle reading “Hello, world!” from 1 to 4 seconds into a video.
