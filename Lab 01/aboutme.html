            <br>
                Hi, Hello There, Whats Shaking.
                <br> 
                I know somethings, and I know nothing.
                I like watching anime and reading manga, since western animation has been cooked for the past few years apart from a select few like invincible, X-men 97 and uhhhhhhhhh nothing else comes to mind.
                <br>
                Now,
                <br>
                Let me yap a little: I am not a big sport guy but someone please explain to me how Luka got traded for AD, AD stands for Anthony Davis for those who dont know, who that is. 
                Was someone asleep?
                Is there another up and coming AD?
                <br>
                Anyways,  
                <br>
                People say excercising is a hobby, but 
                <br>
                Hot Take: in my opinion it shouldn't be classifed as such. It should be a way of life to be healthy.
                Sure you can go outside when you are bored to break a sweat or such, maybe by riding a bicycle, jump roping and etc. but it shouldn't be labeled as a hobby.
                its like saying breathing is a hobby, but you need to breath to... well... stay alive. Kind of the same thing with excercising.

                I like anime, since western animation has been cooked apart from a select few like invincible, X-men 97 and uhhh nothing comes to mind
                I like videogames and play them but I find myself not playing as much as I did before.
                For skills, I say I am pretty good at problem solving sometimes accompanied with creativity and thinking outside the box.

                Trouble Shooting is my jam and Google is my friend.
