    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This tier list is based on the opinions of the community and from my own experiences in Marvel Rivals. 
        While some characters are fun to play, they can also be ridiculously annoying to fight against. 
        But that is the beauty of the game. It isn't overly unbalanced or balanced but, it is a game that serves its purpose.
        <strong>TO BE FUN</strong>
        <p>Side Note: I procastinated alot for this project, had the idea all out and all but still failed to make as "perfect" as I would have loved to have make it. 
            Still had fun though! I am sooooo done, waiting for spring break.</p>
